# elector

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of elector is to run the elections for AIMOS.

- `elector.R` contains a script that runs a mock election for president and vice president. 

- `test-election.csv` contains the gently cleaned test ballots on which it depends.

- `test-election.qsf` contains the qualtrics survey file that generated the data.
