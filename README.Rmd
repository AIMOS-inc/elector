# elector

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of elector is to run the elections for AIMOS.

- `elector.R` contains a script that runs a mock election for all offices (for which there are ballots). 

- `AIMOS_2020_Election_Test.csv` contains the raw test ballots on which it depends.

- `meta_election.csv` contains the metadata which allows cleaning of the test data.

- `test-election.qsf` contains a qualtrics survey file that provides a scaffold for ballot collection.
