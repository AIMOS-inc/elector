# elector

<!-- badges: start -->

<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of elector is to run the elections for AIMOS.

  - `elector.R` contains a script that runs a mock election for
    president and vice president.

  - `test-election.csv` contains the gently cleaned test ballots on
    which it depends.

  - `test-election.qsf` contains the qualtrics survey file that
    generated the data.
