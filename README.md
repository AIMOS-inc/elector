# elector

<!-- badges: start -->

<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of elector is to run the elections for AIMOS.

  - `elector.R` contains a script that runs a mock election for all
    offices (for which there are ballots).

  - `test-election.csv` contains the raw test ballots on which it
    depends.

  - `meta_election.csv` contains the metadata which allows cleaning of
    the test data.

  - `test-election.qsf` contains the qualtrics survey file that
    generated the data.
